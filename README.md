# mongo-scraper

The mongo scraper is an application that reaches out to the Ny Times website and gathers all the most recent 
headlines and displays them so you save them for later or delete them if you don't want to read them. You can also see your saved articles and make notes about them! 

To start click on the scrape articles button and the newest articles will load on the screen. Here you have the option to save or delete the article. Once saved click on the save articles button to view the articles. From here you can make notes about the articles which you can recall once theyre saved by clicking on the button again.
from here you can delete the article when you are done.

This app uses Node modules with Express and Express-Handlebars in conjuction with MongoDB and Mongoose.

Its an easy way to see and save the articles you want and dismiss the ones you don't from the New York Times.
